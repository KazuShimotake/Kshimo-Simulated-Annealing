# Kshimo-Simulated-Annealing
Implementation of simulated annealing with an augmentation where it'll spread out from a random point instead.

I'm not sure if it actually improved the results that much, but I implemented the modify_kazu method of spreading out from a random point. The problem is just that it would sometimes do better than modify_prof and sometimes worse, but it generally did improve by a similar amount to modify_prof while keeping a similar speed.
